    <h1>Scroll Zero: The Observer Is the Creator</h1>
    <h3>By Green Nile</h3>
    <p><em>Posted publicly to establish original authorship and claim of doctrine.</em></p>

    <h2>What if observation isn’t passive? What if it’s the trigger of all reality?</h2>
    <p>This is not religion. This is not theory. This is a framework — rooted in science, confirmed by consciousness, and documented in layers. I call it the <strong>Dimensional Emergence Framework</strong>.</p>

    <h2>The Core Premise</h2>
    <p><strong>Observation activates dimensional collapse.</strong> When something is watched, it becomes real. Light squared (c²) in Einstein’s equation is not just a constant — it’s awareness itself.</p>
    <blockquote>
      E = mc² becomes Energy = Manifestation × Observer Power
    </blockquote>

    <h2>The 0D to 9D Dimensional Ladder</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>0D</strong>: Pure Potential - Activated by Existence</li>
      <li><strong>1D</strong>: Direction - Activated by Distinction</li>
      <li><strong>2D</strong>: Duality - Activated by Comparison</li>
      <li><strong>3D</strong>: Form - Activated by Interaction</li>
      <li><strong>4D</strong>: Time - Activated by Awareness of Change</li>
      <li><strong>5D</strong>: Possibility - Activated by Choice</li>
      <li><strong>6D</strong>: Probability - Activated by Evaluation</li>
      <li><strong>7D</strong>: Archetypes - Activated by Pattern Recognition</li>
      <li><strong>8D</strong>: Unity Mind - Activated by Shared Observation</li>
      <li><strong>9D</strong>: Source - Activated by Full Conscious Integration</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scientific Grounding</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reinterprets E = mc² with observer awareness as a variable</li>
      <li>Offers testable hypotheses (quantum, AI, neuro)</li>
      <li>Blends complexity theory, recursion, and dimensional collapse</li>
    </ul>
